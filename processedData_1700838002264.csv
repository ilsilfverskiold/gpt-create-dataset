The templates will also give you only a snapshot-in-time service, while you will need to keep things chugging in the long-run to remain in good standing. Alternatively, you can ask your lawyer to review the templates, if that saves her/him time and costs you less, but using the templates instead of lawyers makes for a bad recipe.

The service that run this is somewhat old and is using an inifinite loop that runs every x mins and spins every collection task. We are trying to improve this and allow each connection to be run at different intervals and have a better control of those tasks. I've looked into task queues and bullmq to manage this but wanted to check if that makes sense or if someone has built something similar and has some thoughts about bullmq. I've seen that I can run repeatable jobs with it but not sure how easy it is to manage the internal data. I still need to run a main loop to manage those tasks but sounds better than running them synchronously. Any thoughts or experience with task queues or any other way to solve this?

I'm not super tied to labels, I guess. But really, when you think about what's happening with platform engineering, you have engineers that are building internal platforms for other developers. One of the challenges that I've seen happen with platform engineering is that you have platform engineers that go and build a platform and then they get really angry when the other developers aren't using their platform.
